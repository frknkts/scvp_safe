1. ```./exercise8```: Executes the program or script exercise8 in the current directory. Its output is passed to the next command via a pipe (|).

2. ```grep Buffer```: Filters the output of ./exercise8 to include only lines containing the word "Buffer".

3. ```awk '{print $9}'```: Processes each filtered line and extracts the 9th field (column), assuming the fields are separated by whitespace.

4. ```sort```: Sorts the extracted values in ascending order.

5. ```tail -n 1```: Displays the last line of the sorted output, which would be the largest value if the sort is numerical or alphabetical depending on the content.

# Purpose
The command effectively identifies the largest value in the 9th column of lines from ./exercise8 that contain the word "Buffer".
